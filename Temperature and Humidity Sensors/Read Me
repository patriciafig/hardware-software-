Using the DHT11 to measure the temperature and humidity

Use the LCD to display:

                                  Temp:  xx.x F

                                         yy.y C             And then one second later:

                                  Humid:  zz.zz %

                                  T/H Index:  ww.w F         And repeat forever

Use D13 for DHT11 sensor

For this assignment, use millis() for your 1 second timer and every time the timer expires, 
call a routine that will toggle between displaying the data for Temp and the data for Humid/Temp Humid index.
Have a separate part of your code collecting the information and storing it for display.
E.g. two distinct parts of your code: data collection and data display.
